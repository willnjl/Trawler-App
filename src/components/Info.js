          <h3>What is a Supertrawler?</h3>
          <p>
            A supertrawler is an enormous industrial fish factory that are over
            100 meters long.
          </p>
          <p>They have nets that could fit 13 jumbo jets.</p>

          <p>
            Onboard fish processing allows supertrawlers to remain active for
            months.
          </p>

        <div>
          <h3>Supertrawlers are plundering earth's oceans.</h3>
          <p>Nets are a crude and bi-catch is inevitable.</p>
          <p>Supertrawlers operate in marine protected areas.</p>
          <p>The nets can catch hundreds of tonnes of fish everyday</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>The problem is getting worse</h3>

          <p>
            Time spent in marine protected areas by supertrawlers in the first
            half 2020 was more than double than the whole of last year.
          </p>
          <p>This threatens vital ocean habitats and ecosystems</p>
          <p>
            According to Greenpeace data supertrawlers spent 5,590 hours in 19
            of the UK’s marine protected areas in the first six months of 2020,
            compared with 2,963 hours in 39 protected areas in the whole of last
            year
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Supertrawlers hurt economies.</h3>
          <p>
            Supertrawlers are plunding our seas meaning fishing is unsustainable
            long term and taking away livelyhoods of local fishers around the
            world.
          </p>
          <p>
            They can sell their catch wherever they get the best price. Meaning
            even if they catch fish in British waters, it will likely not up on
            British Plates
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>We have an opertunity to make a change.</h3>
          <p>
            Regardless of what you think of leaving the EU, when the UK leaves
            the EU common fisheries policy it will be possible to ban
            supertrawlers
          </p>
          <p>
            Last year 23 supertrawlers operated in UK waters. None we're
            British.
          </p>
          <p>
            This will only happen if people are aware of the scale of the
            problem and lobby their MP's
