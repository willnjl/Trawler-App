## Whats the Big Deal?

### What is a supertrawler?

A supertrawler is an enormous industrial fish factory that are over 100 meters long.

They have nets that could fit 13 jumbo jets.

Onboard fish processing allows supertrawlers to remain active for months.

### Supertrawlers are plundering earth's oceans.

Nets are a crude and bi-catch is inevitable.

Supertrawlers operate in marine protected areas.

The nets can catch hundreds of tonnes of fish everyday

### The problem is getting worse

Time spent in marine protected areas by supertrawlers in the first half 2020 was more than double than the whole of last year.

This threatens vital ocean habitats and ecosystems

According to Greenpeace data supertrawlers spent 5,590 hours in 19 of the UK’s marine protected areas in the first six months of 2020, compared with 2,963 hours in 39 protected areas in the whole of last year.

### Supertrawlers hurt economies.
Supertrawlers are plunding our seas meaning fishing is unsustainable long term and taking away livelyhoods of local fishers around the world.

They can sell their catch wherever they get the best price. Meaning even if they catch fish in British waters, it will likely not up on British Plates.

### We have an opertunity to make a change.

Regardless of what you think of leaving the EU, when the UK leaves the EU common fisheries policy it will be possible to ban supertrawlers

Last year 23 supertrawlers operated in UK waters. None we're British.

This will only happen if people are aware of the scale of the problem and lobby their MP's
